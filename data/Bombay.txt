The Bombay is a medium-sized cat. When you pick her up, she feels considerably heavier than she appears.

This breed is stocky and somewhat compact, but is very muscular with heavy boning. The Bombay is round all over. The head is round, the tips of the ears are round, the eyes, chin and even the feet are round.

The coat of the Bombay is short and glossy. When the coat is in proper condition, its deep black luster looks like patent leather.

The Bombay has a characteristic walk. Her body appears almost to sway when she walks. Again, this walk is reminiscent of the Indian black leopard.

Personality:
Younger Bombays are active, curious cats and adapt very easily to change. At any age, they love to look at the world around them and their favorite place may often turn out to be a window where they can observe the world outside. These cats are very affectionate and will, at times, demand time with their parents.

The Bombay is well known for jumping on a person's lap and spreading her beautiful body across the newspaper the person is reading. However, as they get older, some Bombays can tend to become a bit too placid, preferring to watch rather than get involved in activities.
