The Balinese cat is a variation on the traditional Siamese cat breed that features everything people love about the older breed, but in a fluffier package. The Balinese's long, silky coat is his hallmarkâ€”in fact, it's the very reason for the breed's existence.

Coat notwithstanding, Balinese are everything you know and love about the Siamese: playful, highly intelligent, incredibly devoted to their family units, and engaging conversationalists.
